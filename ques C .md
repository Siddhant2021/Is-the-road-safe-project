I am Siddhant Singhai (211028)
 <br />  I created a city ranking system, best for a living using Kaggle datasheet and using three attributes namely people, planet and profit(Its description is mentioned in code markdown)
 <br />One can create a hypothetical city and input the 3 p's and check its overall ranking in the list or check whether his criteria for judging cities match with the data.
  <br />Then i created a base line condition using mean_absolute_error and modelled a Linear Regression and Random forest data model with division of 100 rows into 60 for training the data and 20 for each testing and validating data, and we saw Linear Regression model was best as it had lowwer validation error than Random Forest
